# Neural Network Sample

A Javascript implementation of a single neural network for learning purposes.

The code is composed of two classes:

* `Perceptron` which is the neuron in itself
* `Trainer` which is basically a data holder for neuron training sets

The [demo](http://malharhak.github.io/Neural-Network-Sample/) is a visualisation of the netwrok trying to guess if a point is over a line or under it, without knowing anything about lines.

This code is a Javascript implementation of [this tutorialon neural networks](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/)
