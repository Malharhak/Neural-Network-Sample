# Neural Network Sample

A Javascript implementation of a single neural network for learning purposes.

The code is composed of two classes:

* `Perceptron` which is the neuron in itself
* `Trainer` which is basically a data holder for neuron training sets

[Demo is available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malharhak/Neural-Network-Sample/master/index.html). Demo code is in the demo folder.

This code is a Javascript implementation of [this tutorialon neural networks](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/)
