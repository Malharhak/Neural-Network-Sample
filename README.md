# Neural Network Sample

A Javascript implementation of a single neural network for learning purposes.

The code is composed of two classes:

* `Perceptron` which is the neuron in itself
* `Trainer` which is basically a data holder for neuron training sets

The demo folder contains demo code producing [a neural network that tried to guess which points are over a line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malharhak/Neural-Network-Sample/master/demo.html)
A sample of a single neural network based on [this tutorial](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/)
